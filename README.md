# SCIENTIFIC PYTHON TUTORIAL

The tutorial will take place over 3 half-days in room  "36 CHR" at building [8C](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7Wygrch4jbpJtZ2W6) on the Bourget du Lac Campus on May the 6th from 09:00 am to 2:00 pm.


## OUTLINE

LaTeX is an open-source (and therefore free) tool for producing high-quality written documents. It has a wide range of applications in the humanities, economics, social sciences, exact sciences and engineering. It enables easy, clean management of mathematical formulas, figures and bibliographies. The module provides participants with the knowledge and practice of this tool, which enables them to concentrate on the organization and meaning of what they want to convey, with the computer and LaTeX's typographic expertise taking care of the rest. LaTeX also works naturally with GIT, making it easy to track the progress of your document and collaborate with others.

## ORGANIZATION

> [!IMPORTANT]
**Before the tutorial* 
>    - xxx
>       - Install the following software:
>          - Python 3.8 or higher
>    - Create a GIThub account.

The module is scheduled over 3 half-days (3x4h):

* **Day 1**: Working with Python: working environments (Visual Studio Code, Jupyter). Basic programming in Python. Scientific and graphical libraries: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numba. Various examples.
* **Day 2**:  Creation of a collaborative and documented library: Creation of a documented library with Sphinx in collaborative mode with Git and GitLab/GitHub. Work organization, unit tests, publication of the documentation. Work on specific scientific topics like advanced graphics for publications with Matplotlib (complex graphics, Latex couplings), image processing, optimization, solving differential equations, machine/deep learning (Scikit Learn, PyTorch), code optimization with Numpy/Numba/JAX...
* **Day 3**: Personal project: each participant proposes to solve a problem with the proposed methods. At the end of this session, the project is realized and returned to the form of a library or a GIT repository.


## PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH

The proposed pedagogical approach is based on examples, individually and collectively according to the participants' research themes. Through these examples, basic skills associated with scientific programming as well as tools more specific to certain themes are addressed.

## SKILLS

Skills acquired at the end of the training :

1. Modify an existing LaTeX document.
2. Create a LaTeX document based on previous work or examples.
3. Write a document collaboratively.

## REMARKS

Each participant must come with a laptop with WIFI connection throughout the module. They must the rights to install software (disk space required: 2 GB). No computer will be provided to participants.
